                        In chess, <strong>tactics</strong> are short combinations that help you win material
                        or create checkmate threats. They usually work because the opponent makes a mistake.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A tactic often appears when a piece is not protected or when the opponent’s king
                        is poorly defended.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Beginners do not need to know many tactics.
                        Learning just a few basic ideas already makes a big difference.
                    </p>
                    <div class="note">
                        Tip: Always look for <strong>checks</strong>, <strong>captures</strong>, and
                        <strong>threats</strong>. These often lead to tactics.

        <!-- FORK -->
        <section class="card">
            <h2>1. Fork</h2>
            <div class="split">

                    <p>
                        A <strong>fork</strong> is a move that attacks two or more pieces at the same time.
                        The opponent usually cannot save all attacked pieces.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Forks are very common with the <strong>knight</strong>, because its movement is hard
                        to predict. However, any piece can create a fork.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Forks are especially strong when one of the attacked pieces is the king,
                        because the king must respond to check.
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Best targets: king + queen or rook</li>
                        <li>Always check if your forking piece is protected</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

        <!-- PIN -->

                    <p>
                        A <strong>pin</strong> happens when a piece cannot move without exposing a more
                        valuable piece behind it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The strongest pin is when a piece is pinned to the <strong>king</strong>.
                        This piece usually cannot move at all.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Even though the pinned piece remains on the board, it becomes much less useful.
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Common pin pieces: bishops and rooks</li>
                        <li>Pins are great for building pressure</li>
                    </ul>

        <!-- SKEWER -->

                    <p>
                        A <strong>skewer</strong> is similar to a pin, but the stronger piece is attacked first.
                        When it moves away, the weaker piece behind it is lost.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Skewers are most effective on open lines, such as files and diagonals.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This tactic often appears later in the game when the board is less crowded.
                    </p>
                    <div class="note">
                        Simple idea: Force a valuable piece to move, then win the piece behind it.

                    <p>
                        A <strong>discovered attack</strong> happens when one piece moves away
                        and reveals an attack from a piece behind it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A very strong version is a <strong>discovered check</strong>,
                        because the opponent must respond to the check immediately.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Discovered attacks are powerful because they create two threats at once.
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Common with rooks, bishops, and the queen</li>
                        <li>Best when the moved piece also creates a threat</li>

                        To improve at tactics, it is better to train a little every day
                        instead of playing very long sessions.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Over time, tactical patterns become familiar and easier to spot.

                    <ul>
                        <li>Solve 5–10 puzzles per day</li>
                        <li>Ask: <strong>Is anything hanging?</strong></li>
                        <li>Look for <strong>checks, captures, threats</strong></li>
