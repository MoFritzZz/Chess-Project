            <h2>What is Chess?</h2>
            <p>
                Chess is a two-player strategy board game played on an 8×8 grid. Players command armies of pieces
                with different movement rules, aiming to checkmate the opponent’s king—placing it under attack
                with no legal escape.
            </p>

            <h2>Origins: India and Chaturanga (c. 6th Century)</h2>
            <p>
                Most historians trace chess back to <strong>chaturanga</strong>, a game that emerged in India around
                the 6th century. Chaturanga included pieces representing different military units and already
                contained the core idea of a king that must be protected.
            </p>
            <p>
                From India, the game spread through trade routes and cultural contact into Persia, where it evolved
                into <strong>shatranj</strong>.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section class="card">
            <h2>Persia: Shatranj and the Birth of Classic Terms</h2>
            <p>
                In Persia, chaturanga became <strong>shatranj</strong>. Many chess terms and concepts were shaped here.
                For example, the word <em>“check”</em> is linked to “shah” (king), and <em>“checkmate”</em> is often
                associated with phrases meaning the king is defeated or helpless.
            </p>
            <p>
                Shatranj was played widely in the Islamic world, where scholars wrote early chess puzzles, analysis,
                and strategy lessons.

            <h2>Arrival in Europe (c. 9th–12th Centuries)</h2>
            <p>
                Chess reached Europe through multiple paths, including Iberia (via Islamic Spain), trade routes,
                and contact during the Crusades. It became popular in courts and among the nobility, eventually
                spreading to wider society.
            </p>
            <p>
                Over time, piece shapes, names, and rules adapted to local cultures—helping the game take on a
                distinctly European identity.

            <h2>The “Queen’s Chess” Revolution (Late 15th Century)</h2>
            <p>
                One of the biggest changes in chess history happened in Europe around the late 1400s: the rules were
                adjusted to make the game faster and more tactical. The most dramatic shift was the increased power
                of the <strong>queen</strong> and <strong>bishop</strong>.
            </p>
            <p>
                These changes transformed chess into a sharper, more dynamic contest—closer to the game we recognize
                today.

            <h2>Early Theory and Printed Books (16th–18th Centuries)</h2>
            <p>
                As printing spread, chess books and analysis became more common. Writers documented openings,
                endgames, and famous match ideas. Chess cafés also rose in popularity, especially in major European
                cities,
                becoming hubs for regular play and discussion.

        <section class="card">
            <h2>Modern Competitive Chess (19th Century)</h2>
            <p>
                The 1800s saw chess become organized and professional. International tournaments began, and
                chess clocks were introduced to manage time. Players developed recognizable styles and more systematic
                opening preparation.
            </p>
            <p>
                The first widely recognized official <strong>World Chess Champion</strong> was
                <strong>Wilhelm Steinitz</strong> (often dated from 1886), who emphasized positional principles that
                shaped modern strategy.

            <h2>The 20th Century: Schools of Thought & Global Champions</h2>
            <p>
                Chess theory expanded rapidly. Competing philosophies—such as classical, hypermodern, and Soviet-era
                training approaches—pushed the game forward. World championships became major international events.
            </p>
            <p>
                Legendary champions (including Capablanca, Alekhine, Botvinnik, Fischer, Karpov, and Kasparov) each
                contributed new ideas and raised the level of play.

            <h2>The Computer & Internet Era (Late 20th–21st Century)</h2>
            <p>
                Computers revolutionized chess preparation, analysis, and training. Game databases made it easy to study
                millions of positions. In the internet era, online chess platforms and streaming introduced chess to
                huge
                global audiences, while engines reshaped how players evaluate positions.
            </p>
            <p>
                Today, chess thrives both over-the-board and online, ranging from casual games to elite tournaments with
                worldwide followings.
