            <h2>What is Chess?</h2>

            <div class="split">

                    <p>
                        Chess is a two-player strategy board game played on an 8×8 grid called a chessboard. Each player
                        starts with sixteen pieces, and every piece moves in a different way. Because of this, the game
                        is not about luck, but about thinking ahead and making good decisions.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The goal of the game is to checkmate the opponent’s king. This means the king is under attack
                        and cannot move to a safe square. The king is never actually captured; the game ends as soon as
                        checkmate is unavoidable.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Chess helps players improve concentration, logical thinking, and problem-solving skills. Even
                        though the basic rules are easy to learn, the game can become very deep and challenging over
                        time. That is why chess is played by beginners and professionals all around the world, both on
                        real boards and online.

        <!-- ORIGINS -->
        <section class="card">
            <h2>Origins: Chaturanga (6th Century)</h2>

            <div class="split">
                <div class="text">
                    <p>
                        Chess comes from an ancient Indian game called <strong> Chaturanga</strong>, which was played
                        around the 6th
                        century. The name refers to four military units: <strong>infantry, cavalry, elephants, and
                            chariots</strong>,
                        which later became the chess pieces we know today.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Chaturanga already focused on <strong>strategy and planning</strong>, especially on protecting
                        the king. This
                        main idea is still the most important rule in modern chess.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Over time, Chaturanga spread to other regions and slowly changed. The rules became clearer, and
                        the pieces developed new movements. Even though chess looks very different today, its basic idea
                        of strategy and king safety started with Chaturanga.

        <!-- PERSIA -->
        <section class="card">
            <h2>Persia and Shatranj</h2>

            <div class="split">
                <div class="text">
                    <p>
                        After spreading from India, chess reached <strong>Persia</strong>, where it became known as
                        <strong>Shatranj</strong>. The game became very popular and was played by people of all ages,
                        especially among scholars and nobility.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Shatranj was similar to <strong>Chaturanga</strong>, but the rules slowly became clearer and
                        more organized.
                        Players started to think more deeply about strategy, planning, and how to protect the king.
                        Many of the basic ideas of modern chess were improved during this time.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        This period is also important because the first chess writings appeared.
                        People wrote about good moves, common mistakes, and interesting positions.
                        These texts helped spread chess knowledge to other regions.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Many chess words we still use today come from <strong>Persian</strong>.
                        The word <strong>“check”</strong> comes from <strong>shah</strong>, which means king.
                        <strong>“Checkmate”</strong> comes from phrases meaning that the king is trapped and cannot
                        escape.
                    </p>

                        Chess arrived in <strong>Europe</strong> between the 9th and 12th centuries,
                        mainly through trade routes and contact with the Islamic world,
                        especially Islamic Spain. From there, the game slowly spread
                        across the rest of Europe.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        During the Middle Ages, chess became very popular among
                        <strong>nobility and royalty</strong>. It was often played in castles and
                        royal courts and was seen as a game that required intelligence,
                        patience, and strategic thinking.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Chess was also used as a teaching tool. People believed it helped
                        train the mind, improve decision-making, and teach important values
                        such as planning ahead and careful thinking. Over time, the game
                        became a common part of European culture.

                    <p>
                        In the late <strong>15th century</strong>, important rule changes transformed chess
                        into a faster and more exciting game. The queen became the most powerful piece,
                        and bishops were allowed to move across the board over long distances.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        These changes made games more dynamic and tactical. Players could attack earlier,
                        create stronger threats, and finish games more quickly than before. Chess became
                        less slow and more focused on active play.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Because of these new rules, chess began to spread even faster across <strong>Europe</strong>.
                        The game we recognize today was largely formed during this time, and most modern
                        rules are still based on these changes.
