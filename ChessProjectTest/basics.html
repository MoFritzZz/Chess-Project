            <h2>The Goal of Chess</h2>
            <div class="split">
                <div class="text">
                    <p>
                        Chess is a two-player strategy game where each player tries to outthink the other.
                        The main goal is to <strong>checkmate</strong> the opponent’s king.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <strong>Checkmate</strong> means that the king is under attack and there is
                        <strong>no legal move</strong> to escape. The king cannot move away, the attack
                        cannot be blocked, and the attacking piece cannot be captured.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The king is never actually captured in chess. As soon as checkmate is forced,
                        the game ends immediately and the attacking player wins.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        During the game, players often put the king in <strong>check</strong>.
                        This is a warning that the king is in danger and must be protected on the next move.
                    </p>

                    <div class="note">
                        Tip: If your king is in <strong>check</strong>, you must react immediately.
                        You can move the king, block the attack, or capture the attacking piece.

        <!-- BOARD -->
        <section class="card">
            <h2>The Chessboard</h2>
            <div class="split">
                <div class="text">
                    <p>
                        Chess is played on a square <strong>8×8 board</strong> with a total of 64 squares.
                        The squares alternate between light and dark colors.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        A simple but important setup rule is that the
                        <strong>bottom-right square must always be light</strong>.
                        If the board is placed incorrectly, the game setup will be wrong.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Each player starts on their own side of the board.
                        The player with the white pieces always makes the <strong>first move</strong>,
                        which is considered a small advantage.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The chessboard can also be described using <strong>coordinates</strong>.
                        Files are labeled from <strong>a to h</strong>, and ranks are numbered from
                        <strong>1 to 8</strong>.
                    </p>

                    <div class="note">
                        Using coordinates helps players describe moves, learn openings,
                        and understand chess diagrams more easily.

        <!-- PIECES OVERVIEW -->
        <section class="card">
            <h2>Pieces at the Start</h2>
            <div class="split">
                <div class="text">
                    <p>
                        Each player begins with <strong>16 pieces</strong>:
                        1 king, 1 queen, 2 rooks, 2 bishops, 2 knights, and 8 pawns.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Pieces have different strengths. In general, the queen is the strongest, pawns are the weakest,
                        but pawns can become very powerful later in the game.
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>King</strong>: most important piece (if it gets checkmated, you lose)</li>
                        <li><strong>Queen</strong>: strongest attacker and defender</li>
                        <li><strong>Rooks/Bishops/Knights</strong>: main fighting pieces</li>
                        <li><strong>Pawns</strong>: small steps, big impact</li>
                    </ul>

        <!-- PIECE MOVES: PAWN -->
        <section class="card">
            <h2>Pawn</h2>
            <div class="split">
                <div class="text">
                    <p>
                        The <strong>pawn</strong> is the smallest and most common piece in chess. It moves forward one
                        square,
                        but captures diagonally. On its very first move, a pawn may move two squares forward.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Pawns cannot move backward, which means every pawn move is important. Even though pawns seem
                        weak,
                        they play a huge role in controlling space and protecting other pieces.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        If a pawn reaches the last rank on the board, it can be promoted into another piece,
                        usually a queen. This makes pawns very dangerous in the endgame.
                    </p>

        <!-- KNIGHT -->
        <section class="card">
            <h2>Knight</h2>
            <div class="split">
                <div class="text">
                    <p>
                        The <strong>knight</strong> moves in an L-shape: two squares in one direction and then one
                        square to the side.
                        It is the only piece that can jump over other pieces.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Knights are very useful in crowded positions where many pieces block the board.
                        They can attack pieces that seem far away and create unexpected threats.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Because the knight’s move is unique, beginners should practice it often to avoid mistakes.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The <strong>bishop</strong> moves diagonally across the board and can travel many squares in one
                        move.
                        Each bishop always stays on the same color square for the entire game.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Bishops are strong when the board is open and long diagonals are available.
                        They are especially powerful when working together as a pair.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Good bishop placement can put pressure on the opponent and control important squares.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The <strong>rook</strong> moves in straight lines: up, down, left, and right.
                        It is a very strong piece, especially later in the game.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Rooks work best on open files, where no pawns are blocking their path.
                        They are often used to control the board and attack important targets.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Two rooks working together are very powerful and can easily dominate open positions.
                    </p>

        <!-- QUEEN -->

                    <p>
                        The <strong>queen</strong> is the strongest piece on the board.
                        She can move like a rook and a bishop combined.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Because the queen is so powerful, losing her early can be a big problem.
                        Beginners should be careful not to move the queen too early in the game.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The queen is excellent for attacking, defending, and finishing games.

                    <p>
                        The <strong>king</strong> is the most important piece in chess.
                        It moves one square in any direction.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Even though the king is not very strong early in the game, protecting it is the main goal.
                        If the king is checkmated, the game is over.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        In the endgame, the king becomes an active piece and helps support pawns
                        and control important squares.
